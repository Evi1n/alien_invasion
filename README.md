# alien_invasion


This game, which I use the pygame module, is a game with a simple interface. We have a spaceship and aliens moving downward. If 5 spaceships are destroyed, the game will be over. There is level and score information in the upper right corner. It will be enough to press the enter key to start the game and the q key to exit the game. Good luck to those who will play!
